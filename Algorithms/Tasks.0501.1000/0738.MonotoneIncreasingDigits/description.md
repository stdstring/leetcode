## 738. Monotone Increasing Digits

Given a non-negative integer ```n```, find the largest number that is less than or equal to ```n``` with monotone increasing digits.

(Recall that an integer has *monotone increasing digits* if and only if each pair of adjacent digits ```x``` and ```y``` satisfy ```x <= y```.)

##### Example 1:
```
Input: n = 10
Output: 9
```
##### Example 2:
```
Input: n = 1234
Output: 1234
```
##### Example 3:
```
Input: n = 332
Output: 299
```

**Note:** ```n``` is an integer in the range ```[0, 10^9]```.
