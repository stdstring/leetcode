## 866. Prime Palindrome

Find the smallest prime palindrome greater than or equal to ```n```.

Recall that a number is *prime* if it's only divisors are 1 and itself, and it is greater than 1.

For example, 2,3,5,7,11 and 13 are primes.

Recall that a number is a *palindrome* if it reads the same from left to right as it does from right to left.

For example, 12321 is a palindrome.

Example 1:
```
Input: n = 6
Output: 7
```
Example 2:
```
Input: n = 8
Output: 11
```
Example 3:
```
Input: n = 13
Output: 101
```

Note:

* ```1 <= n <= 10^8```
* The answer is guaranteed to exist and be less than ```2 * 10^8```.
