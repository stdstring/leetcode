## 2561. Rearranging Fruits

You have two fruit baskets containing ```n``` fruits each. You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays ```basket1``` and ```basket2``` representing the cost of fruit in each basket. You want to make both baskets **equal**. To do so, you can use the following operation as many times as you want:

* Chose two indices ```i``` and ```j```, and swap the ```i```-th fruit of ```basket1``` with the ```j```-th fruit of ```basket2```.
* The cost of the swap is ```min(basket1[i],basket2[j])```.

Two baskets are considered equal if sorting them according to the fruit cost makes them exactly the same baskets.

Return *the minimum cost to make both the baskets equal or* ```-1``` *if impossible*.

### Example 1:
```
Input: basket1 = [4,2,2,2], basket2 = [1,4,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Swap index 1 of basket1 with index 0 of basket2, which has cost 1.
Now basket1 = [4,1,2,2] and basket2 = [2,4,1,2]. Rearranging both the arrays makes them equal.
```
### Example 2:
```
Input: basket1 = [2,3,4,1], basket2 = [3,2,5,1]
Output: -1
Explanation: It can be shown that it is impossible to make both the baskets equal.
```

### Constraints:

* ```basket1.length == basket2.length```
* ```1 <= basket1.length <= 10^5```
* ```1 <= basket1[i],basket2[i] <= 10^9```
