## 2816. Double a Number Represented as a Linked List

You are given the ```head``` of a **non-empty** linked list representing a non-negative integer without leading zeroes.

Return *the* ```head``` *of the linked list after **doubling** it*.

### Example 1:
```
Input: head = [1,8,9]
Output: [3,7,8]
```
### Example 2:
```
Input: head = [9,9,9]
Output: [1,9,9,8]
```

### Constraints:

* The number of nodes in the list is in the range ```[1, 10^4]```
* ```0 <= Node.val <= 9```
* The input is generated such that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros, except the number ```0``` itself.
