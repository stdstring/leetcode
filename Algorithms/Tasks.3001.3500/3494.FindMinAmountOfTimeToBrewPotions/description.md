## 3494. Find the Minimum Amount of Time to Brew Potions

You are given two integer arrays, ```skill``` and ```mana```, of length ```n``` and ```m```, respectively.

In a laboratory, ```n``` wizards must brew ```m``` potions *in order*. Each potion has a mana capacity ```mana[j]``` and **must** pass through **all** the wizards sequentially to be brewed properly. The time taken by the ```i```-th wizard on the ```j```-th potion is ```timeij = skill[i] * mana[j]```.

Since the brewing process is delicate, a potion **must** be passed to the next wizard immediately after the current wizard completes their work. This means the timing must be *synchronized* so that each wizard begins working on a potion **exactly** when it arrives. â€‹

Return the **minimum** amount of time required for the potions to be brewed properly.


### Example 1:
```
Input: skill = [1,5,2,4], mana = [5,1,4,2]
Output: 110
```
### Example 2:
```
Input: skill = [1,1,1], mana = [1,1,1]
Output: 5
Explanation:
Preparation of the 0th potion begins at time t = 0, and is completed by time t = 3.
Preparation of the 1st potion begins at time t = 1, and is completed by time t = 4.
Preparation of the 2nd potion begins at time t = 2, and is completed by time t = 5.
```
### Example 3:
```
Input: skill = [1,2,3,4], mana = [1,2]
Output: 21
```

### Constraints:

* ```n == skill.length```
* ```m == mana.length```
* ```1 <= n, m <= 5000```
* ```1 <= mana[i], skill[i] <= 5000```
